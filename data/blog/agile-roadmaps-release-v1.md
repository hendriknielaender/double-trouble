Roadmaps today are a high-level tool for organizational communication and planning. Typically a
roadmap is build in quarters. Work items grouped as Epics boundle up priorities and deliverables
into colorful bars. Epics have predefined start and ending points. Fulfilling these deadlines is
every product managers dream.

Between the deadlines live the epics. Behind the grand word "EPIC" usually stands a feature - or
multiple. A considerable amount of planned work, needed for a delieverable, or clustered around a
topic. They are "a thing". They are epic. Epics.

## The flaw with Epics

Epics are important for companies to tell a story. To focus and organize intent. IT companies by
and large work agile, with roadmaps, but on a high level, things need to be ordered. They need to
be predictable, plannable, and ultimately deadlineable.

What is true for the micro-cosmos of teams that live & work in iterations called as sprints is not true
for the company on a larger scale. Here we need "some real planning". In reality agile ends,
somewhere near where C-Level begins.

Close to the C-Level live the project managers. The PMs and POs. Here the transformation happens
of turning "a thing" with a start date and an end date, into something iterative and adaptable for
the people in the micro-cosmos. Usually this involves moving the deadline more and more until
finally - success, the epic is done.

In practice this transformation is somewhat of a smear, a blur. The iterative people in the
micro-cosmos learn about the expected deadline hovering above them, while the executive people
learn bits about the mess happening during the execution underground. At it's core, storytelling.

If looked at closely, Epics today represent something that we in the micro-cosmos thought we were
already done with. A predetermined path, planned from beginning to end. After it starts, what
becomes more and more the single focus of the PMs is this: Will we meet the deadline? Endless
deadline sync meeting and status reports show the effort that goes into keeping these two worlds
together: The waterfall-like planning at the top, and the sprints in the microcosmos.

Roadmaps today, a collection of epics and deadlines, are also visually not too far away from the
well-known waterfall processes of the 90s.

## Hypotheses over Epics

> Validate your hypothesis as early as possible.

This is what one valued CEO we both knew, had always preached. In order to validate a hypothesis,
well, first you need to define one. A clearly defined hypothesis, maybe with a PM assigned to it,
to go after it. A hypothesis maybe backed by data, maybe not. A hypothesis might be the grounds to
collect data, or to run feature experiments which bring in this data.

But on todays agile roadmaps, where do we find those hypotheses? What we do have are these
*things*, these bundles of work. Of course a hypothesis stands behind them, maybe its written down
somewhere in *some* shape or form, or maybe it lives in somebodies head. But what is communicated
to the company is not this hypothesis, it is the epic, together with its start and its deadline.

What we think is great about hypothesis, is that they are at the heart of what C-Level wants, and
they are more aligned with agile.

> How could we improve on the madness of deadline syncing, and history book planning in an
> otherwise agile world?

It could be that this hangover of an older world could be helped with hypothesis.

## Hypotheses and Deadlines

What's great about hypothesis is that their deadline - or lets say validation / invalidation
target according to the quote is already clear: it should be as soon as possible.

Not in a way to say everything should be asap, as maybe in an ideal world everything would be, but
in the way that we would really like to find out. You wouldnt want to stay wondering, not for too
long. We assume real wisdom in this quote. If you have a hypothesis, don't sit around, don't
assume, stop guessing. Most importantly, stop calculating imaginary numbers and deadlines, trying
to keep a colorful bar in its original shape.

> Validate it as soon as you can. It is this type of "as soon as you can", that we feel stands
> quite close to the idea of agile iterations. Delivering *some* result as soon as is possible.

It is our assumption that this take on hypothesis from the C-Level is quite close to what we in
the micro-cosmos call an iteration. We see it is something that could potentially bridge the gap
between micro and macro, and which could bring agile all the way to the top level.

What validates or invalidates a hypothesis could be many things. It could be customer feedback,
market research, better monitoring, or the implementation of a new feature.

## Implications of a Hypothesis Roadmap

In a world where instead of epics we focus on hypothesis in the roadmap, one thing is first better
set: the focus and intend of the company. Chasing self-set deadlines, PMs trying to get hands on
big epics for that promotion or raise, that's not quite it.

What truly matters to C-Level, which is to gather insights about the customers and the business
they're in, can be brought from C to Z, all the way to the bottom. Instead of talking about
deadlines and epics, we can focus the brains of the entire organization on what matters in the
end - not whether an epic got stretched or not - but if a good idea was right.

## Introducing Agile Roadmaps

The frustration with the dusty planning surrounding current roadmaps, combined with the key quote
from one of our leaders let us to creating a new type of roadmap. We dub this as "agile roadmaps",
as it moves away the focus from mechanical epic deadline chasing, to honest and scientific
hypothesis validation.

A more agile roadmap in our eyes needs to be one that itself looks more iterative, more cyclical,
instead of an assortment from long bars from the nineties.

Feel free to give the demo a try here, and let us know what you think!

With this MVP we are looking to validate our own hypotheses on this matter, and we'd like to see
the results. If given enough interest we would be happy to pursue this approach and build it out
further.

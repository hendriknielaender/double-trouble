Roadmaps today are a high-level tool for organizational communication and planning. Typically a
roadmap is build in quarters. Work items grouped as Epics boundle up priorities and deliverables
into colorful bars. Epics have predefined start and ending points. Fulfilling these deadlines is
every product managers dream.

Between the deadlines live the epics. Behind the grand word "EPIC" usually stands a feature - or
multiple. A considerable amount of planned work, needed for a delieverable, or clustered around a
topic. They are "a thing".

## The flaw with Epics

Epics are important for companies to tell a story. To focus and organize intent. IT companies by
and large work agile, with roadmaps, but on a high level, things need to be ordered. They need to
be predictable, plannable, and ultimately deadlineable.

What is true for the micro-cosmos of teams that live & work in iterations called as sprints is not true
for the company on a larger scale. Here we need "some real planning". It seems agile ends,
somewhere near where C-Level begins.

Close to the C-Level live the project managers. The PMs and POs. Here the transformation happens
of turning "a thing" with a start date and an end date, into something iterative and adaptable for
the people in the micro-cosmos. Usually this involves moving the deadline more and more until
finally - success, the epic is done.

Epics today represent something that we thought we were done with. A predetermined path, planned
from beginning to end. After it starts, what becomes more and more the single focus of the PMs is:
Will we meet the deadline? Endless deadline sync meeting and status reports shows the effort that
goes into keeping these two worlds together: The waterfall-like planning at the top, and the
sprints in the microcosmos.

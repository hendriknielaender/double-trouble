Moved out from the product engineering blog post for better serparation.

## Context Switch

PMs are not excited at all about developer productivity. How can this be possible?

## Sub-Topic: Meetings

> It needs to be a top priority to increase developer flow. A PM needs to be desperate not
> for a new fancy deadlines, but for absolutely optimized engineering productivity & enablement.

### Dailys

Dailies should be for unblocking engineers and task dependencies, not as a reporting meeting.
Having the daily right before lunch is a great way to keep it in check.
Tip: Skip the daily after a big planning meeting. Big blockers could have been mentioned there
and you can safe the time of coming together again and iterating though everybody.

### Sprint Reviews

Idea: Shorten the boring ticket planning meeting. Introduce a voting system and have a ticket
approved once a subset of engineers voted on it. Not everybody needs to listen for a frontend
ticket grooming.

TODO: find a tool to do that in jira.


## Motivation / Training

> Being productive and creative as a software engineer is crucial and motivation plays a big role in this.

Here are some ways companies can keep their engineers motivated:

- Giving credit where it's due for a job well done
- Providing growth opportunities and room for career progression
- Creating a positive and uplifting workplace atmosphere
- Offering exciting and demanding projects to work on
- Making sure each engineer feels like they're making a difference in the company and its products

> Staying up-to-date with the latest tech and improving your skills is important for software engineers.

Companies can support their engineers by offering:

- Hands-on technical workshops and training sessions
- Attending conferences and events
- Access to online courses and certifications
- Internal training programs and development opportunities
- Mentorship and coaching programs

It's not just about tech though, soft-skills training like project management, teamwork, and communication are also important.
This helps improve the engineers' overall performance and teamwork abilities.


By offering motivation and training, companies can build a work environment that drives productivity, creativity, and employee happiness.

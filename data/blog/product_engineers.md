## Introduction

What do you do as an engineer when you feel your company stops innovating? How could a new idea be
implemented when change itself becomes hard? How can an engineer with an idea for a new feature
make the difference? Should engineers worry about the product at all?

In this massive post we'll look at these questions and different aspect of the term we call as
"product engineering". We will not also analyse the problem but also give hints for the solution
and from our own real life experimentaton with this concept.

## Deceleration, the common cold of grown startups

As startups grow, management starts becoming more complicated and processes sprout like
weeds. Often at the same time, the bottom line, which is what comes out for the user, grows
slimmer and slimmer.

Not only from the top, but also from the bottom, the company is enduring growing pains. New
engineers need to get onboarded which really dont know the product. Older engineers might be
leaving as they're looking for better salaries or new challenges. The new maxime in engineering:
quality over everything. The product works.

Numbers go up and down. Mostly down, but its fine, we have to grow. At some point management will
make it clear that "growing is our status quo" - indicating that if we dont scale our business
together with the new employees, there will be a problem.

And then weirdly, again and again across different startups, the big scale up of new features
doesn't happen. This can be called the common cold of startups. Not every startup might suffer
from it, but it is quite common and the consequences more often than not, are deadly.


## When being a Software Engineer is not enough

A few years back we have already observed this same discussion at one company which happened to
really stop innovating. It was in a kind of slow down phase where layoffs were knocking at the
door. The kind of phase in a grown startup where there is no more free fruit in the kitchen and
management would really like people to pay for their own coffee.

Already then among engineers there was the same discussion for weeks: Should engineers be
responcible to come up with product ideas?

As a software engineer, what is really your job? Isn't your job just to code and leave the feature
ideation to the product department? Shouldnt everybody do only what he is good at, and not worry
about anything else? The question was essentially:

> Should engineers leave the engine room and come up to the navigation bridge?

The answer boils down to this: When the ship sinks, all the crew will sink together. As an
engineer you will again and again join startups which stop innovating on the product, and
eventually you get layed off together with your friends. At that point, the question how you could
have helped naturally starts happening.


## A Common Pitfall: Upgrading useless things

Behind the maxime of quality stands the idea of scalabity. A high quality technical product is
obviously more extensible, and more maintainable. The customer will be happier and the company can
sell for higher prices.

When this maxime reaches engineering, it often puts even experienced engineers in a waking state
of sleep. From feverish bugfixing and hacking of the earliest days, engineering becomes a matter
of ideology.

It is no longer a matter of creating a business, but it now becomes about upgrading every project
in the company to a high engineering standard. Best practice is the song playing in every
development meeting, and everybody is joining in on the dance.

Doing this dance is great and it's needed. But who wants to slightly improve the efficience of a
20 year old engine, when the ship is going to crash? This is when its time to combine quality in
one area with space for innovation in another.

> In the end, it's not about the best code, its about a working product.

This is the difference between a strategy vs plan: Is the task just a plan to extend and improve a
codebase, or is it part of a strategy to increase the market fit?

A lot of teams plan for minor increases, for reworks, this, that and the other. While the revenue
is coming in, that might be fine. For a project that brings in revenue it is worth investing in
its quality.


Plenty of companies that are outside of the initial startup struggle here. Companies like Amazon
try to combat this with slogans like "it's always day one". Though it is just a sentiment, just a
slogan, the idea is needed for many companies.


> The more problems we solve for the user, the more the flow of money into the company can increase.
> Because in the end, it's the developers who create that value.

## Thought Experiment: Why are we called Software Engineers, not Product Engineers?

Software engineers play a crucial role in the development of modern technology and digital products.
But what if they were called "Product Engineers" instead?
This thought experiment ponders the question of why the software development industry has chosen to label
its professionals as "Software Engineers," and what implications this has on their role in the development process.


One key issue that arises is the distinction between "product ownership" and being a "coding monkey."
As the role of software engineers continues to evolve, it's important that they have a clear understanding of the product
they're working on and how it fits into the larger picture of the company.
The more knowledge engineers have about the product, the better decisions they will make,
leading to better results for the company.

Some may argue that product management is the responsibility of product managers (PMs),
but in reality, engineers often plan their own sprints and have a significant impact on the product roadmap.
This highlights the importance of engineers becoming more involved in the product development process and taking on a more
"product-focused" mindset.

In conclusion, it's important for onboarded software engineers to turn into product engineers.
This shift in mindset can lead to better results for the company and a more fulfilling career for the engineer.
By having a clear understanding of the product they're developing and how it fits into the larger picture,
software engineers can make more informed decisions and drive the development process forward in a more effective and impactful way.

## Time To Market: Unit test, Integration Test, Market Test?

> CEO: Test your hypothesis as early as possible

This was a personal learning that our CEO felt strongly about and which he often shared with the
whole company.

> Agile: Releases over deadlines. Actual MVPs over 100% completion

Defining an MVP is a true struggle. Really we are just _planning_(!) the first version of the
product, but not following the strategy to test and rollout products early.

Companies like N26 have been known to dish out minimal features, which were available for
some time, but then disappeared again.
This is almost unimaginable for most IT companies. Features take forever to be implemented
in near perfection, and are almost never rolled back, since having wasted all that time is
an impossibility for the responcible product owners.
Expensive features often turn from experiments to a huge gamble to a long-lasting commitments.
In most cases these products then go into maintenance mode, and people get eager to _plan_(!)
to extend these again with minor advancements. Now you have a team of business people and
engineers talking and planning about a product, which is actually not bringing you anywhere.

> Features that become too big turn from experiments into large scale gambles, and are likely
> to turn into dead maintenance products.

Our recommendation is to give experiments 3 weeks for time to market. Anything after that is
likely to become too big to fail, and will never be rolled back.

The best way to learn is to get product feedback as early as possible, be it direct or indirect feedback.

Feature Experiment Evaluation:
After shipping a feature, we are looking into data to know if the feature serves its intended purpose.
In the end the customer decides:
- Customers give us written feedback on the feature
- Customers are using the feature
- Bookings / Sales increase
- Other more fine-grained data
  - Is the usage time decreased, by making the app more user-friendly?


## The way out

Given the what and the why - how do we move out from here? How can one turn into a product
engineer and help the organization as a whole?

### Time

Understanding the product takes time. Dont be that overmotivated new joiner that wants to change
the company during the probation time. It's not going to work, and it is more than likely that
you're going to work on the wrong things.

Take time to really understand the company and the product. After 1-2 years in a grown startup you
should have seen and understood enough to come up with reasonable solution.

### Failure, your best friend

Your biggest priority as a product engineers is to create MVPs. In the true spirit of agile,
producing -something- at the end of each sprint, that's where you come in.

Your first MVP is going to be bad though. Pretty much no question around that. Creating MVPs is
something that needs practice. Similar to how the first pancake always sucks, we found that across
companies, when a team first does a MVP, it usually sucks at it. But this is your starting point,
and where you and your team can learn valuable lessons.

### Innovation Time

> Innovation time: Moonshots! Break out of the sprint!

Without wiggle room and innovation time, there is no way to make change happen from the bottom up.

### How to get your MVP out the door?

In a company that has decelerated, a weird thing happens. People are desperate for more
customers. Layoffs are around the corner. But release this new feature that might now be perfect?
A feature for which we dont have scientific proof that it will work? No way we will release
that. Whole product departments like to die on this hill.

So when facing such a situation, it is important to know how to dribble 🤣

## TODO move this whole next subsection on agile meetings in a different blog post on lean agile or something?

## Context Switch

PMs are not excited at all about developer productivity. How can this be possible?

## Sub-Topic: Meetings

> It needs to be a top priority to increase developer flow. A PM needs to be desperate not
> for a new fancy deadlines, but for absolutely optimized engineering productivity & enablement.

### Dailys

Dailies should be for unblocking engineers and task dependencies, not as a reporting meeting.
Having the daily right before lunch is a great way to keep it in check.
Tip: Skip the daily after a big planning meeting. Big blockers could have been mentioned there
and you can safe the time of coming together again and iterating though everybody.

### Sprint Reviews

Idea: Shorten the boring ticket planning meeting. Introduce a voting system and have a ticket
approved once a subset of engineers voted on it. Not everybody needs to listen for a frontend
ticket grooming.

TODO: find a tool to do that in jira.


## Motivation / Training

> Being productive and creative as a software engineer is crucial and motivation plays a big role in this.

Here are some ways companies can keep their engineers motivated:

- Giving credit where it's due for a job well done
- Providing growth opportunities and room for career progression
- Creating a positive and uplifting workplace atmosphere
- Offering exciting and demanding projects to work on
- Making sure each engineer feels like they're making a difference in the company and its products

> Staying up-to-date with the latest tech and improving your skills is important for software engineers.

Companies can support their engineers by offering:

- Hands-on technical workshops and training sessions
- Attending conferences and events
- Access to online courses and certifications
- Internal training programs and development opportunities
- Mentorship and coaching programs

It's not just about tech though, soft-skills training like project management, teamwork, and communication are also important.
This helps improve the engineers' overall performance and teamwork abilities.


By offering motivation and training, companies can build a work environment that drives productivity, creativity, and employee happiness.

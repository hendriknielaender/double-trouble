## Introduction

Has it been ages since the last meaningful feature was shipped? Do you have raging customers,
excited about the project - or are they already researching for competitors?

In this massive post we'll look at these questions and different aspect of the term we call as
"product engineering". We will not also analyse the problem but also give hints for the solution
and from our own real life experimentaton with this concept.

## A Common Pitfall: Upgrading useless things

> In the end, it's not about the perfect product, its about a working product.

This is the difference between a strategy vs plan: Is the task just a plan to extend and improve a
codebase, or is it part of a strategy to increase the market fit?


A lot of teams plan for minor increases, for reworks of, this, this, that and the other. While the
revenue is coming in, that might be fine. For a project that brings in revenue it is worth
investing in its quality.


Plenty of companies that are outside of the initial startup struggle here. Companies like Amazon
try to combat this with slogans like "it's always day one". Though it is just a sentiment, just a
slogan, the idea is needed for many companies.


> The more problems we solve for the user, the more the flow of money into the company can increase.
> Because in the end, it's the developers who create that value.

## Thought Experiment: Why are we called Software Engineers, not Product Engineers?

Software engineers play a crucial role in the development of modern technology and digital
products. But...

> What if we were called "Product Engineers" instead? 

This thought experiment ponders over the question why the software development industry has chosen
to label its professionals as "Software Engineers," and what implications this has on their role
in the development process.

One key issue that arises is the distinction between "product ownership" and being a "coding
monkey."  As the role of software engineers continues to evolve, it's important that they have a
clear understanding of the product they're working on and how it fits into the larger picture of
the company. The more knowledge engineers have about the product, the better decisions they will
make, which will yield better results for the company.

In maybe every company engineers really do more than just executing the ticket plan. Features get
challenged on feasibility and cost. Engineers often care more about data security and know about
corner cases in the user workflow. As engineers mature in a company they naturally turn into
product engineers, while they might have started out just as a coder that was unfamiliar with the
business. Seasoned engineers often not only give valueable feedback to the PM, but also come up
with entire product ideas **and** implementations on their own.

Some might argue that product management really is only the responsibility of product managers
(PMs), but in reality, engineers often plan their own sprints and have a significant impact on the
product roadmap. This highlights the importance of engineers becoming more involved in the
product development process and taking on a more "product-focused" mindset.

It seems important for onboarded software engineers to turn into product engineers.  This shift in
mindset can lead to better results for the company and a more fulfilling career for the engineer.
By having a clear understanding of the product they're developing and how it fits into the larger
picture, software engineers can make more informed decisions and drive the development process
forward in a more effective and impactful way.

## Time To Market: Unit test, Integration Test, Market Test?

> CEO: Test your hypothesis as early as possible

This was a personal learning that one of our founding CEOs felt strongly about and which he often
shared in company meetings. If we take this seriously and dont disregard this as a general
sentiment, this has meaningful impact on our day-to-day work.

This advices motivates to create small MVPs. If MVPs take ages, we are no longer in a position to
follow this advice. Agile is supposed to help us here and it urges us to think in terms of
incremental releases over big deadlines. Actual MVPs over 100% completion. In the reality, even
agile planning often looks quite different.

Defining an MVP is a true struggle. Really we are just _planning_(!) the first version of the
product, but not following the strategy to test and rollout products early.

Companies like N26 have been known to dish out minimal features, which were available for some
time, but then disappeared again.  This is almost unimaginable for most IT companies. Features
take forever to be implemented in near perfection, and are almost never rolled back, since having
wasted all that time is an impossibility for the responcible product owners.  Expensive features
often turn from experiments to a huge gamble to a long-lasting commitments.  In most cases these
products then go into maintenance mode, and people get eager to _plan_(!)  to extend these again
with minor advancements. Now you have a team of business people and engineers talking and planning
about a product, which is actually not bringing you anywhere.

> Features that become too big turn from experiments into large scale gambles, and are likely
> to turn into dead maintenance products.

Our recommendation is to give experiments 3 weeks for time to market. Anything after that is
likely to become too big to fail, and will never be rolled back.

The best way to learn is to get product feedback as early as possible, be it direct or indirect feedback.

Feature Experiment Evaluation:
After shipping a feature, we are looking into data to know if the feature serves its intended purpose.
In the end the customer decides:
- Customers give us written feedback on the feature
- Customers are using the feature
- Bookings / Sales increase
- Other more fine-grained data
  - Is the usage time decreased, by making the app more user-friendly?


## The way out

Given the what and the why - how do we move out from here? How can one turn into a product
engineer and help the organization as a whole?

### Time

Understanding the product takes time. Dont be that overmotivated new joiner that wants to change
the company during the probation time. It's not going to work, and it is more than likely that
you're going to work on the wrong things.

Take time to really understand the company and the product. After 1-2 years in a grown startup you
should have seen and understood enough to come up with reasonable solution.

### Failure, your best friend

Your biggest priority as a product engineers is to create MVPs. In the true spirit of agile,
producing -something- at the end of each sprint, that's where you come in.

Your first MVP is going to be bad though. Pretty much no question around that. Creating MVPs is
something that needs practice. Similar to how the first pancake always sucks, we found that across
companies, when a team first does a MVP, it usually sucks at it. But this is your starting point,
and where you and your team can learn valuable lessons.

### Intrinsic Motivation

> Being productive and creative as a software engineer is crucial and motivation plays a big role in this.

Here are some ways companies can keep their engineers motivated:

- Giving credit where it's due for a job well done
- Providing growth opportunities and room for career progression
- Creating a positive and uplifting workplace atmosphere
- Offering exciting and demanding projects to work on
- Making sure each engineer feels like they're making a difference in the company and its products

> Staying up-to-date with the latest tech and improving your skills is important for software engineers.

Companies can support their engineers by offering:

- Hands-on technical workshops and training sessions
- Attending conferences and events
- Access to online courses and certifications
- Internal training programs and development opportunities
- Mentorship and coaching programs

It's not just about tech though, soft-skills training like project management, teamwork, and communication are also important.
This helps improve the engineers' overall performance and teamwork abilities.


By offering motivation and training, companies can build a work environment that drives productivity, creativity, and employee happiness.

### Innovation Time

> Innovation time: Moonshots! Break out of the sprint!

Without wiggle room and innovation time, there is no way to make change happen from the bottom
up. So to implement change while everybody is working an incremental, sleepy plan that leads
nowhere, you may need to set some time aside to work on new ideas yourself.

This can be called as innovation time and is sometimes even an official process in engineering
companies.

What can be done when there is no such time and there is no wiggle room to get anything done
outside of the daily work? Well first you would be surprised what you can get done in little
amount of time with the right tools and intrinsic motivation. When there is really a product
engineer that is breathing down your neck it might be actually time to leave. But in many other
situations,

> You get wiggle room by making wiggle room.

This might be a very bold move depending on the company and situation. In reality when you
actually make stuff work people will soon forget about the actual ticket you were supposed to
implement. But for the situation where this is not the case, maybe this take on innovation from
Elon can give you a new perspective.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you punish people too much for failure then they will respond accordingly and the innovation you will get will be very incrementalist. Nobody is going to try anything bold for fear of getting fired. <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@elonmusk</a> <a href="https://t.co/RkopioBUtx">pic.twitter.com/RkopioBUtx</a></p>&mdash; Tesla Owners Silicon Valley (@teslaownersSV) <a href="https://twitter.com/teslaownersSV/status/1455056935158358019?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


### How to get your MVP out the door?

In a company that has decelerated, a weird thing happens. People are desperate for more
customers. Layoffs are around the corner. But release this new feature that might now be perfect?
A feature for which we dont have scientific proof that it will work? No way we will release
that. Whole product departments like to die on this hill.

So when facing such a situation, it is important to know how to dribble 🤣

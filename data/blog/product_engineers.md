> In the end, it's not about the best code, its about a working product.

Strategy vs plan: Is the task just a plan to extend a feature, or is it part of a
strategy to increase the market fit.


A lot of teams plan for minor increases, for reworks, this and that. While the revenue
is coming in, that might be fine. But even established projects need to prove their market fit
and stay agile.


Plenty of companies that are outside of the initial startup struggle - though they might call
themselves startups - often stop innovating. Companies like Amazon try to combat this
with slogans like "it's always day one". Though it is just a sentiment, just a slogan, the
idea is needed for many companies.


> The more problems we solve for the user, the more the flow of money into the company can increase.
> Because in the end, it's the developers who create that value.

## Thought Experiment: Why are we called Software Engineers, not Product Engineers?

Software engineers play a crucial role in the development of modern technology and digital products.
But what if they were called "Product Engineers" instead?
This thought experiment ponders the question of why the software development industry has chosen to label
its professionals as "Software Engineers," and what implications this has on their role in the development process.


One key issue that arises is the distinction between "product ownership" and being a "coding monkey."
As the role of software engineers continues to evolve, it's important that they have a clear understanding of the product
they're working on and how it fits into the larger picture of the company.
The more knowledge engineers have about the product, the better decisions they will make,
leading to better results for the company.

Some may argue that product management is the responsibility of product managers (PMs),
but in reality, engineers often plan their own sprints and have a significant impact on the product roadmap.
This highlights the importance of engineers becoming more involved in the product development process and taking on a more
"product-focused" mindset.

In conclusion, it's important for onboarded software engineers to turn into product engineers.
This shift in mindset can lead to better results for the company and a more fulfilling career for the engineer.
By having a clear understanding of the product they're developing and how it fits into the larger picture,
software engineers can make more informed decisions and drive the development process forward in a more effective and impactful way.

## Time To Market: Unit test, Integration Test, Market Test?

> CEO: Test your hypothesis as early as possible

> Agile: Releases over deadlines. Actual MVPs over 100% completion

Defining an MVP is a true struggle. Really we are just _planning_(!) the first version of the
product, but not following the strategy to test and rollout products early.

Companies like N26 have been known to dish out minimal features, which were available for
some time, but then disappeared again.
This is almost unimaginable for most IT companies. Features take forever to be implemented
in near perfection, and are almost never rolled back, since having wasted all that time is
an impossibility for the responcible product owners.
Expensive features often turn from experiments to a huge gamble to a long-lasting commitments.
In most cases these products then go into maintenance mode, and people get eager to _plan_(!)
to extend these again with minor advancements. Now you have a team of business people and
engineers talking and planning about a product, which is actually not bringing you anywhere.

> Features that become too big turn from experiments into large scale gambles, and are likely
> to turn into dead maintenance products.

Our recommendation is to give experiments 3 weeks for time to market. Anything after that is
likely to become too big to fail, and will never be rolled back.

The best way to learn is to get product feedback as early as possible, be it direct or indirect feedback.

Feature Experiment Evaluation:
After shipping a feature, we are looking into data to know if the feature serves its intended purpose.
In the end the customer decides:
- Customers give us written feedback on the feature
- Customers are using the feature
- Bookings / Sales increase
- Other more fine-grained data
  - Is the usage time decreased, by making the app more user-friendly?

## Context Switch

PMs are not excited at all about developer productivity. How can this be possible?

## Sub-Topic: Meetings

> It needs to be a top priority to increase developer flow. A PM needs to be desperate not
> for a new fancy deadlines, but for absolutely optimized engineering productivity & enablement.

### Dailys

Dailies should be for unblocking engineers and task dependencies, not as a reporting meeting.
Having the daily right before lunch is a great way to keep it in check.
Tip: Skip the daily after a big planning meeting. Big blockers could have been mentioned there
and you can safe the time of coming together again and iterating though everybody.

### Sprint Reviews

Idea: Shorten the boring ticket planning meeting. Introduce a voting system and have a ticket
approved once a subset of engineers voted on it. Not everybody needs to listen for a frontend
ticket grooming.

TODO: find a tool to do that in jira.

## Innovation Time

> Innovation time: Moonshots! Break out of the sprint!

The real crux of engineering, what makes or breaks engineering departments is impressing each other.
Engineers that are impressed by each other try to be better. Engineers that see others not trying
hard are likely to be aiming lower. Teams that see each other just fixing linting errors, might themselves
get lost in the nitty gritty. For sure the junior developer will be confused by this prioritization, and
lay his efforts in the same non-product direction.

## Motivation / Training

> Being productive and creative as a software engineer is crucial and motivation plays a big role in this.

Here are some ways companies can keep their engineers motivated:

- Giving credit where it's due for a job well done
- Providing growth opportunities and room for career progression
- Creating a positive and uplifting workplace atmosphere
- Offering exciting and demanding projects to work on
- Making sure each engineer feels like they're making a difference in the company and its products

> Staying up-to-date with the latest tech and improving your skills is important for software engineers.

Companies can support their engineers by offering:

- Hands-on technical workshops and training sessions
- Attending conferences and events
- Access to online courses and certifications
- Internal training programs and development opportunities
- Mentorship and coaching programs

It's not just about tech though, soft-skills training like project management, teamwork, and communication are also important.
This helps improve the engineers' overall performance and teamwork abilities.


By offering motivation and training, companies can build a work environment that drives productivity, creativity, and employee happiness.

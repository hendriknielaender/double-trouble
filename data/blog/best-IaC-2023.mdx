The recent release of [bun 1.0](https://bun.sh/blog/bun-v1.0) still has us all hyped up. The
unseen speed of bun, together with a completely overhauled dev experience by unifying the wide
range of tools into one is simply amazing. This new sense of speed and convenience got us thinking
also about other tools - what about IaC?

At the workplace, the choice of IaC tooling is largely determined by company policy, by what is
generally already used and works reasonably well. Through years of evolution and growing maturity,
a hand ful of projects have gained the most popularity: CDK and terraform[^11]. But taking a fresh look
today, what could currently be the best tool in the context of serverless AWS?

Let's find out and explore the best infrastructure tools of the year. We'll evaluate
currently available infrastructure as code (IaC) tools, and look at them within certain
categories. This is in a specific context which we believe is relevant today: A lambda function
within an AWS account, which runs ontop of bun.

*All the code related to this comparison can be found in this repository:* <GithubRepoTag text="lambda-iac-2023" repoSlug="flyck/lambda-iac-2023" stargazers="0" issues="0"/>.

## Contenders

### Terraform

<GithubRepoTag text="Terraform" repoSlug="hashicorp/terraform" stargazers="39.1k" issues="1.7k"/> is
an IaC tool that allows you to create both cloud and on-premise infrasture, with providers
available for all major clouds (<GithubRepoTag text="terraform AWS provider" stargazers="9k"
issues="3.8k"/>). The code is comprised of the hashicorp language, a custom language for
templating. It supports basic programming features like loops, modules and variables within
certain limits[^6] [^7] [^8] [^9] [^10].

### Open Tofu

Terraform has recently announced a scary license change, which might restrict the availiability of
terraform in the future. For this reason, the open terraform dubbed as <GithubRepoTag
text="opentofu" repoSlug="opentofu/opentofu" stargazers="15.3k" issues="119"/> repository has been
started in protest. If the license change goes through, this will be a more future-proof version
of terraform, while it has the same core features. Providers won't be affected.

### CDK

The <GithubRepoTag repoSlug="aws/aws-cdk" text="CDK" stargazers="10.7k" issues="1.9k"/> is the
programmatic solution from AWS for IaC tooling. The AWS CTO himself Werner Vogels praised the CDK
as revolutionary [^1] [^2], and it was the first tool from AWS to offer infrastructure code
definition via a regular programming language. The initial hype for the CDK has led to a wide
adaption, while it also exposed its limits and shortcomings.

### CDKTF

While the CDK uses AWS CloudFormation under the hood, <GithubRepoTag text="CDKTF"
repoSlug="hashicorp/terraform-cdk" stargazers="4.6k" issues="296"/> uses terraform. This allows to
break the boundaries which exist in certain cases in the hashicorp configuration syntax, and use
"real code". It attempts to combine the benefits of terraform with the flexibility offered by the CDK.

### SST

The serverless stack <GithubRepoTag text="sst" repoSlug="sst/sst" stargazers="18.1k"
issues="660"/> is a combination of tools which aims at providing the best modern developer
experience for fullstack application building. Historically it was comprised of a collection of
streamlined CDK constructs and a live lambda development console. Recently the new and improved
SST Console has been added, which aims at improving the overview over the provisioned
resources. It is like the CDK but with massive batteries included.

### Serverless Framework

An oppiniated tool aimed at simplicity and developer experience around serverless services is the
<GithubRepoTag text="serverless framework" repoSlug="serverless/serverless" stargazers="45.3k"
issues="1k"/>. While it is also connected to a web console for CI/CD, monitoring and debugging,
the main part - the cli makes it easy to deploy lambdas, api gateways and more. Infrastructure is
defined in one yaml file, which can be extended with various plugins.

### AWS SAM

Possibly the initial Amazonian answer to the Serverless Framework is <GithubRepoTag text="AWS SAM"
repoSlug="aws/aws-sam-cli" stargazers="6.4k" issues="383"/>. It's maskot is a little beaver, which
is supposed to help get your things running in the cloud. While it is not as sophisiticated as the

CDK, it has many features which are more geared towards developer productivity, which is also why
the CDK has dependencies on SAM for things like local execution.

<br />
*Non-Contenders*: Among the wide assortment of tools which can be used to provision infrastructure,
there are some we didn't consider for various reasons. For the interested reader, we're still
listing them here for completeness: AWS Cloudformation, AWS Copilot, AWS Composer, AWS App
Runner, AWS Proton, AWS Lightsail, AWS EBS & AWS Amplify. Pulumi is also not yet part of our
ranking as we have never seen it used, but we might add it in the future.


## Evaluation

<RankingTable />

Glossary:
- Init time: Some IaC frameworks use some kind of resources for state or access management,
which is shared across IaC projects within the same account.
- Versatility Rating: The ability to add other infrastructure ontop of the lambda function and extend the given stack
- "Depl" is here the abbreviation for "Deployment"

#### Evaluation Takeaways

What we immediately learned from the evaluation:


- AWS has some variety in the time the api calls take, which we especially observed for
the lambda updateFunction call. It can be as fast as 15s but a moment later it might be at
35s. This makes a true obsession and optimization for speed a little bit difficult, and leaves the
numbers in that code category more as a median than an exact value.
- Debugger integration depends on the tool working together with the build utility. As bun is
still in the early stages, bun is not yet supported by most of the tools.

#### Cloudformation and the Limits of Abstraction

Most of the IaC tools we can chose from use Cloudformation under the hood. It's emphasis
historically has been moving infrastructure from one sane state to the next. Changing
infrastructure was a bit scary, and Cloudformation was a great tool in that scenario. In todays
world, for whatever reason, it seems the parameters have changed. Updates today seem to be far
more frequent, and dependencies between resources exist more in lambda code, rather than
infrastructure definitions. While this might not be the whole reason, the observation is that the
whole Cloudformation state handling in serverless seems like a feature that is a little bit of a
surplus. Recently added flags like cdks `--hotswap` and `--no-rollback`show, that a perfect
stack state is no longer the most relevant. Still, if anything in those IaC tools breaks, you will
have to dive deep into the Cloudformation level.

This begs the question if future AWS IaC tools will always depend on Cloudformation, requiring you
as the user to dive into intricacies of that, or if a new methodology will arise. This additional
layer of tooling under the hood is at least something that is already a minor inconvenience,
dealing with serverless infrastructure today. Many infrastructure tools still expect you to dive
into Cloudformation when needed, while wholistic tools that try to hide all abstractions have
failed (Amplify, Beanstalk). It will be interesting to see if this sea of complexity can ever be
bridged.

#### AWS and Speed

A critical insight from our analysis is the inherent speed limitations imposed by AWS's core API calls. Despite advancements in IaC tools, they struggle to match the lightning pace of platforms like bun when interacting with AWS services.
of of speed by the core api calls made to AWS. This greatly diminishes the possibility for IaC
tools to be anywhere near as fast as bun while dealing with AWS. To give an example, removing an
AWS IAM role takes around 30s. This is just the api call itself. Updating lambda function code
takes around 15s with some variation. Creating a VPC adapter for a lambda takes multiple
minutes. Or, to give a far-out example, updating a cloudfront distribution takes up to 20
minutes. Historically AWS doesnt promise any speed on their general apis. The aws docs are
intentionally fuzzy in this aspect.


But this is not to say it will always be this way. Maybe AWS will come up with an upgrade which
greatly increases their deployment-related api calls. These kind of things already happened
recently with Eventbridge for example, one api call here improved in speed significantly. Other
approaches for speed could also be possible. If code changes would be live-streamed to AWS (like
with the sst), and compilation plus deployment happened already within your AWS network, this
could further increase deployment times, but these approaches would be more intricate.


## On the sidelines: Winglang

<GithubRepoTag text="Winglang" repoSlug="winglang/wing" stargazers="2.6k" issues="671"/> is an
up-and-coming IaC tool, but it is also more than that. It got founded in late 2022[^5] by the
original creator of the code that eventually became the CDK, Elad Ben-Israel
[@emeshbi](https://twitter.com/emeshbi). At its core it is a new programming language, which uses
one piece of code to instruct both the infrastructure and the business logic together (called as
"preflight" vs "inflight" code). It hereby diffuses the division between infrastructure and
application code, bringing them all into the same place.

The wing project itself is a combination of this new wing programming language, a local cloud
simulater & dashboard, together with exports into different IaC tools (terraform or cdk), so they
can provision the needed infrastructure after compilation. At the moment they are [not yet
production ready](https://www.winglang.io/contributing/status), and only a few resources are
supported. Yet, the most important serverless resources are already there: a lambda function, SQS
queues, a bucket and a dynamoDB table (as the primitive form of a "counter").

Let's see an example of this. The following snipped is just the example snippet from their
website, and it creates a bucket, a lambda, an sqs queue and a dynamodb for the counter:

```typescript
bring cloud;

let queue = new cloud.Queue(timeout: 2m);
let bucket = new cloud.Bucket();
let counter = new cloud.Counter(initial: 100);

queue.setConsumer(inflight (body: str): str => {
  let next = counter.inc();
  let key = "myfile-${next}.txt";
  bucket.put(key, body);
});
```

In our estimate Winglang is a huge leap forward from the current paradigms of IaC. If it can
deliver on its promises, it might not be the solution that the whole engineering uses for every
project, but it might be that awesome tool to get small things done with ease and pleasure. Given
that Wing works with JSII just like the CDK, it can also import JSII compatible code like the CDK
back into its code. Seems Elad really fell in love with this concept here. With this wing might be
even somewhat similar to SST, by giving better abstractions ontop of the CDK, just on a whole
different level.

Wing seems to aim to bring the developer experience to such a level of abstraction and simplicity,
that even a project manager could solve simple problems. This is something that none of the other
infrastructure related tools have so far attempted.

## Yan Cui & Stuvy

Interestingly [Yan Cui](https://theburningmonk.com/) has also recently discussed the topic of
infrastructure tools and bun lambdas together with AJ Stuyvenberg. While the stackoverflow
developer survey doesnt cover the IaC tool usage and studies on this are rare (but they to
exist[^11]), it is re-assuring to see that also such renowned engineers ponder on the question of
tool popularity. In the podcast they agreed that big enterprise companies mostly use terraform,
while some positive points on the serverless framework (Cui) and the CDK (Stuvy) were made. At the
same time Yan Cui mentioned that the CDK is less popular than he thought, which we can confirm,
while Stuvy said the real winner is CloudFormation. This is true to the extend that most tools use
CloudFormatino under the hood.

Stuvyenberg also points out that in some cases running bun lambdas from a
[container](https://aaronstuyvenberg.com/posts/why-you-should-not-use-lambda-layers) is more
beneficial than with a layer ontop of AL2 and a zip file. At the same time he does also recommend
to run bun via a lambda layer. [Chalice](https://aws.github.io/chalice/index.html) was also listed
in their list of IaC tools, which is yet to be added to our ranking. Definitely give the episode a
listen if you are into bun and serverless!

## Rounding up

Going into writing this post, we had a suspicion that terraform was simply going to be fastest, as
it doesn't rely on CloudFormation under the hood. After years of being the reigning champion - at
least within our proximity - the reputation of the CDK for us and others[^3] [^4] has
weakened. CDKs weird packaging, together with the v2/v3 migration efforts, the various
work-arounds and helpers needed to work with the CDK, the disappointment of "awesome reusable
contructs" remaining mostly a theory. Going into it we thought to find out that something like
terraform was going to be the best after all.

Looking at the range of tools that is available, it has become again obvious that some are more
geared towards serverless development than others. At the same time within your own organization
you may have teams which have a different areas of focus. Having these serverless-tuned tools for
us made for a far better development experience, less frustrations and faster
iterations. Depending on your flexibility, in the end it might not be a question of "the best
tool", but choosing different tools depending on the purpose.
